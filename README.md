# Finance-Domain-BI-Deshboard-
Steps:
1) Extracted the data Into MySQL, created a database, and made connections between them, finally Imported data to PowerBi data sets, and ETL processes from the MySQL database - a great opportunity for me to revise the SQL commands.

2) Did Data wrangling, Data Cleaning, Data modeling, and finally created amazing Dashboards.
   Data modeling with snowflake scheme across > 10 tables

3) Creating more (and really a lot more) calculated measures using DAX formulas

4) Dashboarding including views for 4 different target audiences - Finance, Sales, SupplyChain, Executive (For upper management people like CEO etc)

5) Incorporating stakeholder feedback during UAT - it really took some effort to think of how and what to present given the limited real estate on a single    view. Thankfully, we could make use of tooltip functionality to create supplemental views!

6) Deploying the solution via PowerBI web service

7) The first time Added a Navigation bar for all pages and Gave it a Dynamic Website look ...
   love this end-to-end project which involves:


One Major takeaway from the project I learned is, that it's not about the tool, it is about solving the problem.
